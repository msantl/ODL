SDNStatsCollector
– Responsible for setting “counters” for every PN at specified network
locations (physical or logical). A counter is a set of OpenFlow flow entries in ODC-enabled
network switches and routers. The SDNStatsCollector periodically collects statistics from
those counters and feeds them to the SDNBasedDetectionMgr (see the description below).
The module uses the SDNStatsCollectionRep to both set the counters and read latest
statistics from those counters. A stat report consists of read time, counter specification, PN
label, and a list of trafficData information, where each trafficData element contains the
latest bytes and packet values for flow entries configured for <protocol,port,direction> in
the counter location. The protocol can be {tcp,udp,icmp,other ip}, the port is any Layer 4
port, and the direction can be {inbound, outbound}.
